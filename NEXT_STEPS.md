# Next Steps - Testing the Fix

## Quick Summary

✅ **Fixed**: The mention detection issue that was finding 0 mentions  
📋 **Status**: Ready for testing  
⏱️ **Time Needed**: 2-3 minutes to test

## What Was the Problem?

Your console showed:
```
Me @ GitHub: Detected username: patrick-knight
Me @ GitHub: Found 0 mentions
```

This meant the extension was loading but couldn't find any of the 8 mentions on the page.

## What Was Fixed?

1. **Multiple Selectors** - Now searches 4 different ways to find mentions
2. **Timing Fix** - Waits 500ms for GitHub to load content
3. **Better Debugging** - Added detailed logs to help diagnose issues
4. **Improved Selectors** - Better title element detection

## How to Test (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Reload the Extension
```
1. Open Chrome
2. Go to: chrome://extensions/
3. Find "Me @ GitHub"
4. Click the reload icon (🔄)
```

### 2. Visit the Issue Page
```
1. Go to the GitHub issue where you're mentioned
   Example: github.com/github/accessibility/issues/9373
2. Press F5 to refresh the page
3. Wait 1 second for extension to initialize
```

### 3. Check Console Logs
```
1. Press F12 (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
2. Click "Console" tab
3. Look for "Me @ GitHub:" messages
```

## What You Should See

### ✅ Success Scenario

**Console:**
```
Me @ GitHub: Initializing on https://github.com/...
Me @ GitHub: Detected username: patrick-knight
Me @ GitHub: Found 8 potential mention links     ← Should be > 0 now!
Me @ GitHub: Link 1: text="@patrick-knight", href="/patrick-knight"
Me @ GitHub: Link 1 matches current user!
Me @ GitHub: Added mention from link 1
... (more links) ...
Me @ GitHub: Found 8 mentions in user-mention links
Me @ GitHub: Found 8 mentions                    ← Should be 8 now!
Me @ GitHub: Found title element: <h1>
```

**Page:**
- Blue badge "@8" appears next to issue title
- Mentions have light blue background
- Hover over mention shows ← → controls
- Click badge shows dropdown with all mentions

### ❌ Still Broken? (Scenarios)

#### Scenario A: Still "Found 0 mentions"
Console shows:
```
Me @ GitHub: Found 0 potential mention links
Me @ GitHub: Found 0 mentions
```

**Action Required:**
1. In DevTools, click "Elements" tab
2. Find a mention on the page (like @patrick-knight)
3. Right-click the mention → "Inspect"
4. Look at the HTML for the `<a>` tag
5. Copy the entire `<a>` tag HTML
6. Share it so we can add the right selector

Example of what to look for:
```html
<a class="???" data-???="???" href="...">@patrick-knight</a>
```
We need to know the class name and attributes.

#### Scenario B: Mentions found but not showing
Console shows mentions found but nothing appears on page.

**Action Required:**
1. Check for any error messages in console
2. Inspect the page title element
3. See if counter badge exists in HTML but is hidden

#### Scenario C: JavaScript errors
Red error messages in console.

**Action Required:**
1. Copy the exact error message
2. Note the file and line number
3. Share the error

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Could not find title element"
- GitHub may have changed their HTML structure
- We need to inspect the page title to see what selectors to use

### Problem: Multiple counters appearing
- Extension is initializing multiple times
- Check if there are duplicate "Initializing" messages

### Problem: Extension not loading at all
- No "Me @ GitHub:" messages in console
- Check extension permissions in chrome://extensions/

## Reporting Results

1. **Console Output** - Copy all "Me @ GitHub:" messages
2. **Screenshot** - Show the issue page with/without features
3. **Status** - Working / Partially working / Not working
